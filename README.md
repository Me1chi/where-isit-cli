I study in a city far from home.

This application is meant to help me keep track of where my things are.

You're supposed to choose the kind of location (e.g. Cities, Houses, Places in bedroom, etc...).
It will be prompted every launch until you choose a kind.

The current location of the item will be printed in green, among the others in gray.
